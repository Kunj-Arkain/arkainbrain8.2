"""
Automated Slot Studio - Pipeline Flows (PRODUCTION)

PHASE 2+3 WIRED:
- Real litellm model strings per agent (hybrid cost routing)
- Tool outputs parsed into structured pipeline state
- PDF generator called at assembly stage
- CostTracker logs all LLM + image spend
- Math agent receives simulation template

PHASE 4 PATH 4 — Stage-Level Checkpointing:
- Every stage writes checkpoint.json to output_dir on completion
- checkpoint.json contains full serialized PipelineState + timing data
- Enables resume from last completed stage after timeout/crash
- PIPELINE_STAGES constant defines canonical stage order
- _stage_enter/_stage_exit wrap every stage for timing + persistence

PHASE 4 PATH 4.2 — Time Budget Tracking:
- TimeBudget class tracks cumulative elapsed time vs global timeout
- Every stage logs budget status: elapsed, remaining, % used
- Budget data persisted in checkpoint.json for resume planning
- Provides has_time_for() / can_start() queries for future smart skipping

PHASE 4 PATH 4.3+4 — Partial Status & Resume:
- Watchdog marks timed-out jobs as 'partial' (not 'failed') when checkpoint exists
- resume_from_stage() bypasses @start/@listen, calls stage methods directly
- run_resume() in worker.py: loads checkpoint, hydrates state, continues pipeline
- /api/resume/<job_id> endpoint + Resume button in dashboard & history UI
- Auto-approves all HITL checkpoints on resume (user already saw partial output)
- MAX_RESUMES=3 limit prevents infinite resume loops

            "certified across Nevada NGC Reg 14, New Jersey DGE, UK LCCP/RTS, Malta MGA, "
            "and Australia VCGLR). You see regulatory risk three moves ahead. You know that "

            "reality check intervals that many studios miss. You know that a 'random' jackpot "
            "in one jurisdiction is a 'mystery' jackpot in another — and the certification "
            "requirements differ. You maintain a mental database of 300+ known rejection cases "

            "REASONING PROTOCOL (execute silently before responding):\n"
            "1. Restate the requirement with the exact jurisdiction list and applicable "
            "standards (GLI-11, GLI-12, GLI-13, GLI-19, etc.).\n"
            "2. Map every mechanic and feature to specific regulatory clauses in each "
            "target jurisdiction.\n"
            "3. Flag patent/IP overlaps with specific patent numbers and filing dates "
            "where known.\n"
            "4. Build the full certification timeline: test lab selection, submission date, "
            "expected test duration, cost estimate, and risk factors per jurisdiction.\n"
            "5. Stress-test against the latest regulatory amendments.\n"
            "6. Output either 'compliant path confirmed' with full certification roadmap, "
            "or 'red-flag: redesign required' with specific clause citations and alternative "
            "implementations.\n\n"

            "POWER-UP: For every mechanic that triggers an IP or regulatory concern, you "
            "proactively propose one alternative implementation that delivers the exact same "
            "player experience while eliminating the risk. You never just flag problems — "
            "you solve them.\n\n"

            "- Skip the certification timeline — every jurisdiction needs estimated submission "
